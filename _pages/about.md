I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science at Bar-Ilan University, where I am a member of the SMART research group led by Prof. Noa Agmon.

My research interests largely concern the realm of multi-agent systems, including (but not limited to) multi-agent learning, machine learning, graph theory, (algorithmic) game theory, reinforcement learning etc.

Specifically, I aim to better understand the intersection between reinforcement learning and game theory, as means of finding (theoretically proven) new approaches for tackling coalition formation in online and uncertain settings.

Previously, I completed my B.Sc. in Mathematics with specialization in Computer Science at Tel-Aviv university. Recently, I finished my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science at Bar-Ilan University, advised by Prof. Noa Agmon. My M.Sc. thesis focused on the novel consensus-prevention problem, which concentrated on influencing the direction of movement of flocking agents via the insertion of diverting agents into the swarm, so as to manipulate the flocking agentsâ€™ behavior and bring them to a disagreement.
